# Mainte

- Designed screen resolution is 1920x1080
- Each overlay has their own dependancies
  - vnstat    : for network usage statistics
  - python3   : where complex logic was needed for text formatting
  - playerctl : for media status and metadata
  - radeontop : for AMD GPU statistics

# Setting Up

Clone the repo to a desired location and run conky on all the overlays. You can use conky manager or any tool to manage the theme, or [this](https://github.com/AyoItsYas/bin/blob/main/conkyd) simple script should suffice.
